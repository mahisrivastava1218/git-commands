git rebase is a Git command used to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
It's often used to:
Clean up your commit history.
Apply changes from one branch on top of another.
Avoid merge commits and maintain a linear project history.

âœ… With Rebase (Cleaner History)
git checkout feature/login-ui
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
Now your commits are rebased onto the latest main:

* Your commit 2
* Your commit 1
* Commit on main by teammate

Your changes appear as if they were written on top of the latest main. ðŸ”¥

Command	Use Case
git rebase main	Rebase your work on top of the latest main
git rebase -i HEAD~3	Clean up last 3 commits (squash, reword)
git rebase --continue	Continue after resolving a conflict
git rebase --abort	Cancel a rebase
